                <h2> Why I Love Statistics </h2>
                <p class = "stat_sum"> Why do I love Statistics? I learned over years of trying new fields and disciplines that I stopped seeing 
                my experience in learning facts, here and there, about the anatomy of the cniadaria - the size of the US judicial branch - the 
                last words Helen spoke at the conclusion of <cite>Homer's The Illiad</cite>, that I just didn't like retaining and regurgitating. 
                Instead, I found that the most exciting thing for me to learn was tools - the <strong> tools to learn </strong> about the world. That's 
                how I see Statistics. It's a discipline that teaches me how to work with things that I may know nothing about intially - answer questions 
                that may feel like an expert needs to answer. 
                </p>
                <p class = "stat_sum"> Statistical testing and modeling is a satisfying, constantly-rewarding (except when the R code won't debug!), and tools-focused 
                discipline that I've grown to love. On this page of my site, I'm sharing some the statistical investigations, data explorations, and ideas I've had over 
                time while working in this field. This is by <strong> no means comprehensive </strong>, but it shows some of my highlights.

                        such as IMDB rating, genre, and budget to see which variables are significant predictors of the film passing the Bechdel Test.
                        We found some interesting results - IMBD rated movies which failed the Bechdel Test higher, Action films more regularly failed than passed,

                        In the beginning of Econometrics we were told to do a simple, guided regression assignment using a specified variable 
                        and model. I decided on my free time to explore a food insecurity index variable as a independent variable, and 
                        run a simple OLS regression on a number of predictor variables - race, population, drought risk, etc.

                    intensity... and what's fascinating is that out of 100 players, only one person survives to the end. I was interested enough
