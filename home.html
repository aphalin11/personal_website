            <p > Hello! My name is Aaron. I'm a Senior at Lawrence University, studying Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science in balance with my passion for 
                environmental stewardship. Clean code, clean homework, and clean ecosystems! In my spare time I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to constantly 
                improve my skills in marketing myself and learning how the web works. As a consequence, I am constantly a work in progress. I also play a fair amount of 
                video games, mainly Overwatch, and going on hikes/jogs through natural parks and forests, practicing my identification skills for the variety of plants 
                I've befriended in the Midwestern ecosystem. </p>
            <p > This website is intended for two big reasons. First is to provide a casual, constantly-updating glimpse into my skillsets and ideals for future employers 
                and for possible careers. The second is to give me a project to meaningfully practice and extend more skills. I love the feeling of a clean set of 
                links growing as I do more data analysis projects in R, more Java assignments in Computer Science, and more website projects. </p>
