                        the end title doesn't do much justice in summarizing my interests and constantly growing skills in other fields outside of 
                        explaining market supply/demand and running cool regressions.

                    <p class = "me_summary"> In my classes outside of the Economics department I've been completing courses in Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, alongside higher-level Statistics. Outside of the classroom
                        I've been learning web development and hands-on ecological management. For the past three summers, I've been engaged in 
                        restoration ecology, learning plants deep to their roots with botanical classifications and interdependent species.
